### The Opera:
[The Hegemon-King Bids His Lady Farewell](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%9C%B8%E7%8E%8B%E5%88%AB%E5%A7%AC_(%E4%BA%AC%E5%89%A7))(霸王别姬) tells the battle between Xiang Yu (项羽) and Liu Bang(刘邦), known as [Chu–Han Contention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chu%E2%80%93Han_Contention) (206-202 BC). When Xiang Yu is on the verge of total defeat, his wife Consort Yu(虞姬) committed suicide alongside Xiang Yu with his *sword*.  

### The Movie:  
[The film adaptation of the same name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farewell_My_Concubine_(film)) as a historical drama sets in politically tumultuous 20th-century China in five different periods: the late Qing Dynasty(1900-1912), the Republican Era (1912-1930), the Japanese occupation (1931-1945), the new people's Republic(1949-1950s) and the Cultural Revolution(1966-1976). It chronicles the troubled relationships between two lifelong friends, the Peking opera actors Cheng Dieyi (程蝶衣) and Duan Xiaolou (段小楼), and Xiaolou's wife Juxian (菊仙).   

 *"The film examines the survival of traditional art forms like Peking opera amidst political turmoil, with the Peking opera presenting as both a cultural foundation and a site of personal conflict."*
