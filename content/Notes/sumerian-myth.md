The basic narrative of Ni 12501 is one in which the storm god Ishkur is held captive in the netherworld (kur). Ishkur's father, Enlil, convened a divine assembly, asking one of the other gods to retrieve Ishkur. However, only Fox volunteers to go. Fox successfully entering the kur by accepting the food and drink offered to him but hiding them in his receptacle instead of eating them. It is unknown whether Fox successfully completes the rescue[^2].  

The story preserved on Ni 12501 is so far unique, and there is no evidence that detailed knowledge of it survived into later periods. Scholar Dr. Jana Matuszak[^3] examined the mythical narrative contained in the tablet hence adds significantly to our knowledge of Mesopotamian mythology, while also offering glimpses into the use of motifs in telling stories about the mythological past.  

Noted that the Sumerian language has been dead for 4,000 years. Spoken by the people of Sumer, an ancient Mesopotamian civilization in modern-day Iraq, it is one of the world’s oldest recorded languages. It is also considered an isolate, meaning it’s not related to any known language.[^1]
