> The word “genius” in German has a special overtone, even a tinge of the demonic, a mysterious power and energy; a genius—whether artist or scientist—is considered to have a special vulnerability, a precariousness, a life of constant risk and often close to troubled turmoil. – Fritz Stern

**Sonderweg**: "special path,” a German equivalent of “American Exceptionalism.”  

**Innerlichkeit**: inwardness, it manifests the inwardly-looking structures of the mind; consider also the symphony, which is (usually) wordless and beyond words.

**Bildung**: self-cultivation and the desire to “enlarge” ourselves and those around us.   

*Innerlichkeit and Bildung both are German tendencies which have been explicitly named and praised as virtues over many centuries.*
