There are generally two views on Governance:   

The **decision function** view of governance treats governance as function where the inputs are the wishes of various legitimate stakeholders and the output is the decision:  
$$
f(x_1, x_2, ... x_n) \to y
$$  

The **coordination model** of governance sees governance exists in layers: the bottom layer is the *laws of physics* themselves, which is the ultimate decision layer; the second layer is coordination institutions, which create *focal points* around how and when act in order to better coordinate behavior.
