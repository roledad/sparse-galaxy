**abstract idea**: *There is a certain quantity of energy (which can be calculated/computed) that does not change in the manifold changes which nature undergoes.*  

**block analogy:**  
- energy “chunks”, they can be hidden in different places (forms), but when you count all places correctly, the total stays the same  
- there are different forms (gravitational, kinetic, heat, elastic, electrical, chemical, radiant, nuclear, mass) of energy and each has a formula.  

*Thus energy is a number you compute from the state of a system. It’s not a material substance; it’s a conserved quantity that makes the bookkeeping of nature come out right.*  

**Equations:**  
*gravitational potential energy:* **$E_p = mgh$**  
*change in energy:* **$\Delta$ = (force) x (distance force acts thru)**  
*kinetic energy:* **$E_k = \frac{WV^2}{2g} = \frac{mv^2}{2}$**  

**Concepts: conservation laws**  
- three subtle, involving space and time but not depend on absolute time and space:  
1. conservation of energy  
2. conservation of linear momentum  
3. conservation of angular momentum  

- three in the sense of counting blocks:  
1. conservation of charge 
2. conservation of baryons  
3. conservation of leptons
