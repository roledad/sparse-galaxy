poppy war, stay true, breakneck... 

[Sept 1 2025]  
reading the notes/references in *"BREAKNECK"* might be more interesting than the chapters...  

also making up a note for *Bodega* while I was searching for its definition. [a piece in NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/13/arts/design/deli-bodega-ramps-accessibility.html) described the bodega ramps as art of glaciers, pancakes, clamshells or lava... This is such a mixed feeling about it, or even broader about New York culture, that the ramps are not typically built to meet regulations but praised by new yorkers as “Tactical urbanism” in the term of art. This leaves to think about the art forms and justify with state of order.

On governance: on the way back from the gym in Gowanus today, there were three people holding flags on a section of Fourth Ave that was under construction. They were there putting up flags in the air that says *go* and *stop*, which I followed their instruction did what they say. Why do people follow these flags? Because everyone else is already following these flags, and you have the incentive (benefit) to do the same thing as what everyone else is doing.
